### Unstable
![stability-unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-yellow.svg)

The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable.

### Stable
![stability-stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-stable-green.svg)

The API has proven satisfactory, but cleanup in the underlying code may cause minor changes. Backwards-compatibility is guaranteed.
